# coffee-chats
creating a coffee-chats algorithm and ui

## Files' navigation:
- JS file (containing all logic) is read_write/write.js
- index.html contains the UI
- package.json and yarn.lock contain all npm dependencies used
- csv files in /read_write are used for testing purposes
    - In the final MVP, all read/write processes should be completed on one csv file
- All other files are irrelevant (used for testing during the build process)
    - Should be deleted in the final version
